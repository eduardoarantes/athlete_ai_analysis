Stay hydrated and cool with a fan if needed during the test to ensure no external factors influence your heart rate.\n\nEnsure that you maintain the same cadence throughout (whatever is most comfortable for you) the test so we can directly measure what your heart rate is doing without influence from changing cadence.\n\nCan you please let us know what the environmental conditions are at the time of the test?

The reason you do the 5min all out effort is to remove the anaerobic contribution to your 'aerobic threshold'. You will have plenty of time to recover after the 5min effort before doing your 20min effort. We will take 95% of your average power across the 20minutes as your FTP.\n\nDo this test either on a hill, a flat consistent road with no interruptions or on a flat criterium track.\n\nThe best way to approach this test is to have a target in mind so that you don't go out too hard. You want to manage your effort well at the start so you can maintain the right power. You should aim for similar to your previous best to begin with or even slightly higher and then once you know you are capable of more and feel strong, lift 10-20w and hold on for as long as you can. Don't worry if you power drops off, just keep pushing as hard as you can. If you feel like you have energy left in the final few minutes, empty the tank.\n\nYou should finish this test completely empty, so don't leave anything on the road!!\n\nGood luck and give it your all!",

The reason you do the 5min all out effort is to remove the anaerobic contribution to your 'aerobic threshold'. You will have plenty of time to recover after the 5min effort before doing your 20min effort. We will take 95% of your average power across the 20minutes as your FTP.\n\nDo this test either on a hill, a flat consistent road with no interruptions or on a flat criterium track.\n\nThe best way to approach this test is to have a target in mind so that you don't go out too hard. You want to manage your effort well at the start so you can maintain the right power. You should aim for similar to your previous best to begin with or even slightly higher and then once you know you are capable of more and feel strong, lift 10-20w and hold on for as long as you can. Don't worry if you power drops off, just keep pushing as hard as you can. If you feel like you have energy left in the final few minutes, empty the tank.\n\nYou should finish this test completely empty, so don't leave anything on the road!!\n\nGood luck and give it your all!",
