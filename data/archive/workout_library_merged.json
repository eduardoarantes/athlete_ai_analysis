Stay hydrated and cool with a fan if needed during the test to ensure no external factors influence your heart rate.\n\nEnsure that you maintain the same cadence throughout (whatever is most comfortable for you) the test so we can directly measure what your heart rate is doing without influence from changing cadence.\n\nCan you please let us know what the environmental conditions are at the time of the test?

We are focusing on increasing the time at this stage, not the intensity. This will force your body to work aerobically and build the metabolic machinery that results in a higher threshold, while also increasing your Time to Exhaustion (TTE) which is a key determinant of endurance performance.\n\nFocus on keeping a comfortable cadence. You can do these efforts on hills or flats if you're riding outside, but just make sure the recovery intervals are as set out below. It may be easier to get these done indoors, on Zwift etc.",

You want to manage your effort well at the start so you can maintain the right power. You should aim for similar to your previous best to begin with or even slightly higher and then once you know you are capable of more and feel strong, lift 10-20w and hold on for as long as you can. Don't worry if you power drops off, just keep pushing as hard as you can. If you feel like you have energy left in the final few minutes, empty the tank.\n\nYou should finish this test completely empty, so don't leave anything on the road!!\n\nGood luck and give it your all!",
