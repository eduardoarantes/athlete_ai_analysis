# Threshold Training

## Overview

Threshold training targets the physiological boundary between sustainable aerobic exercise and unsustainable anaerobic effort. This intensity corresponds to the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), where lactate production equals lactate clearance. Training at or near this threshold improves the body's ability to buffer lactate, clear metabolic byproducts, and sustain higher power outputs before accumulating debilitating fatigue.

In cycling, threshold training typically focuses on Functional Threshold Power (FTP)—the highest power a cyclist can maintain in a quasi-steady state for approximately one hour. FTP serves as the primary reference point for training zones and provides an objective measure of aerobic fitness progression. Threshold-focused training gained prominence through the work of Dr. Andrew Coggan and Hunter Allen, who established power-based training zones anchored to FTP.

## Scientific Basis

Lactate threshold training induces several key physiological adaptations that enhance endurance performance. At the muscular level, it increases the density and efficiency of mitochondria, improving oxidative capacity. It upregulates monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) that facilitate lactate shuttling between muscle fibers and clearance to the liver. Cardiovascular adaptations include increased stroke volume and improved oxygen delivery to working muscles.

The threshold represents a metabolic tipping point where blood lactate concentration begins rising exponentially. Training at this intensity teaches the body to operate efficiently at high aerobic power without crossing into the severely fatiguing anaerobic domain. This "sweet spot" provides substantial training stimulus while remaining sustainable enough for meaningful work durations (10-60 minutes).

## Implementation Guidelines

### Zone Definition

Threshold training centers on Zone 4 (Coggan power zones):

- **Sweet Spot (88-93% FTP):** Upper Zone 3, sustainable for extended periods, high training benefit-to-fatigue ratio
- **Threshold Zone 4 (91-105% FTP):** Classical lactate threshold intensity, core of threshold training
- **Sub-threshold (<88% FTP):** Below threshold, aerobic endurance focus
- **Supra-threshold (>105% FTP):** Above threshold, shorter intervals, higher fatigue

Heart rate zones (approximate, individual variation exists):
- Sweet Spot: 88-93% FTP ≈ 88-92% max HR
- Threshold: 91-105% FTP ≈ 92-98% max HR

### Interval Structures

**Classic Threshold Intervals:**

2x20 minutes @ FTP (95-100% FTP):
- Most common threshold workout
- 10-15 minute recovery between intervals
- Total time at intensity: 40 minutes
- Suitable for experienced cyclists with solid aerobic base

3x15 minutes @ FTP:
- Alternative to 2x20, useful when building tolerance
- 8-10 minute recovery between intervals
- Total time at intensity: 45 minutes
- Good for transitioning from base to build phase

4x10 minutes @ 100-105% FTP:
- Higher intensity, shorter duration
- 5-7 minute recovery between intervals
- Total time at intensity: 40 minutes
- Develops power slightly above threshold

**Sweet Spot Intervals:**

3x20 minutes @ 88-93% FTP:
- Lower fatigue than true threshold
- Sustainable for longer durations
- Total time at intensity: 60 minutes
- Excellent for accumulating time in zone

2x30 minutes @ 88-92% FTP:
- Extended sweet spot work
- High training stimulus, manageable fatigue
- Suitable for experienced riders

**Over-Under Intervals:**

4x8 minutes (1min @ 105% FTP / 2min @ 95% FTP):
- Simulates race surges above threshold
- Teaches lactate management and power modulation
- 6 minute recovery between intervals
- Highly specific for criteriums and challenging terrain

### Workout Frequency

**Base Phase (12-16 weeks):**
- 1 threshold session per week
- Focus on volume at lower intensities
- Use sweet spot intervals to introduce intensity

**Build Phase (8-12 weeks):**
- 2 threshold sessions per week
- One sustained (2x20), one varied (over-unders)
- Maintain base volume at lower intensities

**Peak Phase (4-6 weeks):**
- 2 threshold sessions per week
- Shorter, more intense intervals
- Reduce total volume, maintain intensity

**Recovery Weeks:**
- 1 threshold session per week
- Reduced duration (1x20 or 2x15)
- Every 3-4 weeks

### Practical Workout Examples

**Early Season Threshold Builder:**
- 20min warmup (Zone 1-2)
- 3x15min @ 95% FTP (10min recovery Zone 1-2)
- 15min cooldown
- Total: ~105 minutes

**Mid-Season Classic 2x20:**
- 25min warmup including 3x1min @ threshold
- 2x20min @ 98-100% FTP (12min recovery Zone 1)
- 15min cooldown
- Total: ~90 minutes

**Race-Specific Over-Unders:**
- 20min warmup
- 4x8min (1min @ 105% FTP, 2min @ 95% FTP repeating)
- 6min recovery between sets
- 15min cooldown
- Total: ~90 minutes

**Sweet Spot Endurance:**
- 15min warmup
- 2x30min @ 88-92% FTP (10min recovery)
- 15min cooldown
- Total: ~110 minutes

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting Too Hard**
   - Problem: First interval executed at 105-110% FTP, subsequent intervals collapse
   - Why it matters: Defeats purpose of sustained threshold work, accumulates excessive lactate
   - Solution: Conservative pacing first interval, allow 2-3 minutes to settle into rhythm, power should feel "comfortably hard"

2. **Insufficient Warmup**
   - Problem: Beginning threshold intervals without adequate preparation
   - Why it matters: Reduced performance, higher injury risk, unpleasant experience
   - Solution: Minimum 20-minute progressive warmup, include 2-3 short efforts (30-60sec) near threshold intensity

3. **Inadequate Recovery Between Intervals**
   - Problem: Reducing recovery to 3-5 minutes between 20-minute efforts
   - Why it matters: Incomplete lactate clearance compromises subsequent intervals
   - Solution: 10-15 minute easy spinning between long threshold efforts, monitor heart rate drop as recovery indicator

4. **Excessive Threshold Volume**
   - Problem: Multiple threshold sessions per week without adequate base, or 3+ threshold days
   - Why it matters: High fatigue-to-benefit ratio, suppresses immune system, overtraining risk
   - Solution: Limit to 1-2 threshold sessions per week, separate by 72+ hours, build aerobic base first

5. **Ignoring Environmental Factors**
   - Problem: Attempting prescribed threshold workouts on hilly terrain or in headwinds
   - Why it matters: External resistance disrupts steady power output, reduces workout quality
   - Solution: Use flat routes or indoor trainer for threshold work, adjust expectations for outdoor variability

6. **Confusing Threshold with VO2max**
   - Problem: Executing threshold intervals at 110-120% FTP
   - Why it matters: Different training stimulus, inappropriate recovery, workout failure
   - Solution: Reference FTP accurately, use power meter, stay within prescribed zones

## Monitoring and Progression

### Performance Indicators

**Power-Based Metrics:**

Average power in threshold intervals:
- Should remain stable across intervals
- Example: 2x20min should show <3% power drop between intervals
- Increasing power at same perceived effort indicates adaptation

Normalized Power (NP) vs. Average Power:
- NP should closely match average power in steady intervals
- Large discrepancy indicates pacing inconsistency
- Variability Index (NP/AP) should be <1.03 for threshold work

**Heart Rate Response:**

Cardiac drift:
- Heart rate rise during sustained intervals
- Less drift over time indicates improved cardiovascular efficiency
- Monitor HR in standardized workouts (same power, conditions)

Heart rate recovery:
- Faster recovery between intervals shows improved fitness
- Track 1-minute post-interval HR drop

**Subjective Assessment:**

RPE tracking:
- Threshold work should feel RPE 7-8 (hard but sustainable)
- Same power feeling easier over time indicates adaptation
- Use Borg CR-10 scale for consistency

Perceived sustainability:
- Ability to complete final interval as strong as first
- Confidence in extending interval duration

### Progression Strategies

**Duration Progression:**

Weeks 1-2: 3x12min @ FTP
Weeks 3-4: 3x15min @ FTP
Weeks 5-6: 2x20min @ FTP
Weeks 7-8: 2x25min @ FTP

Increase duration 10-15% every 2 weeks, assess tolerance

**Intensity Progression:**

Weeks 1-4: 2x20min @ 93-95% FTP (sweet spot)
Weeks 5-8: 2x20min @ 95-98% FTP (threshold)
Weeks 9-12: 2x20min @ 98-100% FTP (at/slightly above FTP)

Gradual intensity increase maintains sustainability

**Volume Progression:**

Phase 1: 1 threshold session per week
Phase 2: 2 threshold sessions per week (one sustained, one intervals)
Phase 3: 2 threshold sessions per week (both sustained or mixed)

Never add duration and intensity simultaneously

### Testing Protocol

**20-Minute FTP Test:**

1. 20min warmup (Zone 1-2) with 3x1min efforts
2. 5min recovery
3. 20min maximal sustained effort
4. FTP = 95% of average power from 20min effort
5. 10min cooldown

Perform every 6-8 weeks to track progression

**Ramp Test Alternative:**

1. 15min warmup
2. Start at 100W (or 50% estimated FTP)
3. Increase 20W every minute until failure
4. FTP = 75% of highest 1-minute power
5. 10min cooldown

Faster assessment, useful for frequent testing

### Adaptation Timeline

Week 1-2: Neuromuscular adaptation, improved pacing
Week 3-4: Improved lactate buffering, reduced RPE at same power
Week 5-6: Measurable FTP increase (2-5%), better recovery
Week 7-8: Sustained improvements, higher sustainable power
Week 9+: Plateau, require increased stimulus or recovery block

Typical FTP improvements: 5-10% in first 8-week block, 3-5% in subsequent blocks

### Integration with Other Training

Threshold training fits within polarized or pyramidal intensity distributions:

**Polarized Model (80/20):**
- 80% time Zone 1-2, 15% Zone 4, 5% Zone 5
- 1-2 threshold sessions per week
- Majority of volume at easy intensity

**Pyramidal Model:**
- 70% Zone 1-2, 20% Zone 3-4, 10% Zone 5
- 2 threshold sessions per week
- Moderate volume tempo/threshold

**Threshold-Focused Block:**
- Specific 4-6 week mesocycle
- 2-3 threshold sessions per week
- Reduced volume at other intensities
- Follow with recovery week
