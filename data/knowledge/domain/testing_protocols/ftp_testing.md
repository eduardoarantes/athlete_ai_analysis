# FTP Testing Protocols

## Overview

Functional Threshold Power (FTP) represents the highest power output a cyclist can sustain in a quasi-steady state for approximately one hour without fatiguing. Introduced by Dr. Andrew Coggan and popularized through Training and Racing with a Power Meter, FTP serves as the cornerstone metric for power-based training. It provides an objective, repeatable measure of aerobic fitness and establishes individualized training zones for structured workouts.

FTP testing protocols aim to estimate this one-hour power through shorter, more practical test formats. The most common approaches include the 20-minute test (95% of average power), the ramp test (75% of maximal 1-minute power), and the full 60-minute test. Each protocol offers different trade-offs between accuracy, repeatability, and practical feasibility. Proper FTP assessment requires controlled conditions, full recovery, and maximal effort to produce reliable results that guide months of training.

## Scientific Basis

FTP closely approximates the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS)—the highest intensity where lactate production equals clearance. At this intensity, athletes can maintain homeostasis without progressive lactate accumulation that leads to fatigue. Research demonstrates strong correlations (r > 0.95) between laboratory-measured MLSS and field-tested FTP in trained cyclists.

The physiological markers at FTP include blood lactate concentrations of 2-4 mmol/L, ventilatory threshold (VT2), and approximately 80-85% of VO2max. These markers explain why FTP serves as an effective training intensity anchor—it represents the transition point between predominantly aerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic metabolism. Training zones derived from FTP target specific physiological adaptations across the aerobic-anaerobic continuum.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Prerequisites

**Physical Readiness:**
- Minimum 6 weeks base training completed
- No illness or injury affecting performance
- Well-hydrated and properly fueled
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) previous night

**Recovery Status:**
- 48 hours minimum since last hard workout
- 24 hours since any training
- Consider 2-3 day taper for important tests
- Avoid testing during recovery week

**Equipment Setup:**
- Power meter calibrated according to manufacturer protocol
- Consistent bike setup (position, tire pressure, gearing)
- Indoor trainer or outdoor flat course identified
- Heart rate monitor optional but useful for comparison

**Environmental Control:**
- Indoor trainer preferred for repeatability
- If outdoor: flat course, minimal traffic, low wind
- Temperature 18-22°C optimal
- Fan for cooling during indoor tests

### 20-Minute FTP Test Protocol

This is the most common and practical FTP testing protocol.

**Structure:**
1. **Warmup (20-30 minutes):**
   - 10min easy spinning (Zone 1-2)
   - 3x1min efforts at 100%, 110%, 120% estimated FTP
   - 2min easy between efforts
   - 5min easy spinning to settle

2. **Pre-Test Effort (5 minutes):**
   - 5min all-out effort to clear anaerobic system
   - Deplete neuromuscular capacity
   - 10min easy recovery after

3. **Test Effort (20 minutes):**
   - Start timer, begin sustained maximal effort
   - Target highest sustainable power for full 20 minutes
   - Avoid starting too hard—conservative first 3 minutes
   - Gradually increase effort if feeling strong
   - Final 5 minutes should be maximal

4. **Cooldown (10-15 minutes):**
   - Easy spinning to clear lactate
   - Gradual reduction in intensity

**FTP Calculation:**
- FTP = 95% of average power from 20-minute test
- Example: 280W average → 266W FTP (280 × 0.95)
- Record average power, normalized power, heart rate

**Pacing Strategy:**
Minutes 0-3: Conservative start at 97-98% target power
Minutes 4-10: Settle into rhythm at 100% target power
Minutes 11-17: Hold steady, resist urge to increase
Minutes 18-20: Maximum effort, empty the tank

### Ramp Test Protocol

Shorter test useful for frequent assessment or athletes who struggle with pacing.

**Structure:**
1. **Warmup (15 minutes):**
   - 15min progressive from Zone 1 to Zone 3
   - No hard efforts required

2. **Ramp Test:**
   - Start at 100W (or 50% estimated FTP)
   - Increase 20W every 60 seconds
   - Continue until unable to maintain target power
   - Test ends when power drops >10W below target for 5 seconds

3. **Cooldown (10 minutes):**
   - Easy spinning

**FTP Calculation:**
- FTP = 75% of highest 1-minute average power achieved
- Example: Highest 1-minute power 320W → 240W FTP (320 × 0.75)
- Some platforms (TrainerRoad, Zwift) use proprietary algorithms

**Advantages:**
- Shorter duration (40 vs. 70 minutes total)
- Less psychological difficulty
- Good for frequent testing (every 4 weeks)

**Disadvantages:**
- Less sport-specific than sustained efforts
- May underestimate FTP in experienced cyclists
- More variable between tests

### 60-Minute FTP Test

True FTP measurement, rarely performed due to intensity.

**Structure:**
1. Warmup (30 minutes)
2. 60-minute maximal sustained effort
3. Cooldown (15 minutes)

**FTP = average power from 60 minutes**

Used primarily for validation or special assessments.

### 8-Minute Test Alternative

Two 8-minute maximal efforts with 10 minutes recovery.

**FTP Calculation:**
- Average power across both efforts
- FTP = 90% of average power
- Useful for time-crunched athletes
- Less accurate than 20-minute test

## Common Mistakes

1. **Inadequate Warmup**
   - Problem: Starting test cold, skipping intensity openers
   - Why it matters: Reduces power output by 5-10%, invalid results
   - Solution: Follow full 20-30 minute warmup protocol, include short hard efforts

2. **Overpacing First 5 Minutes**
   - Problem: Starting 20-minute test at 105-110% sustainable power
   - Why it matters: Premature fatigue, significant power drop, failed test
   - Solution: Conservative start at 95-98% target, allow body to settle, increase gradually

3. **Testing While Fatigued**
   - Problem: Performing FTP test after hard training block without recovery
   - Why it matters: Underestimates true FTP by 10-20W, invalidates training zones
   - Solution: 48-72 hours rest before testing, consider short taper for key assessments

4. **Inconsistent Testing Conditions**
   - Problem: Comparing outdoor test to indoor test, different courses, varying equipment
   - Why it matters: Introduces confounding variables, reduces comparison validity
   - Solution: Standardize testing protocol, same location/setup, document conditions

5. **Incorrect FTP Calculation**
   - Problem: Using 100% of 20-minute power as FTP, forgetting scaling factors
   - Why it matters: Overestimates FTP by 5%, makes workouts too difficult
   - Solution: Always apply 95% factor to 20-minute test, 75% to ramp test

6. **Too-Frequent Testing**
   - Problem: Testing FTP every 2-3 weeks
   - Why it matters: Disrupts training rhythm, insufficient time for adaptations
   - Solution: Test every 6-8 weeks during build phase, 8-12 weeks in base phase

## Monitoring and Progression

### Data Analysis

**Primary Metrics:**

Average Power:
- Core metric for FTP calculation
- Should increase with training adaptations
- Track absolute values and watts/kg

Normalized Power (NP):
- Should closely match average power in steady test
- Large difference indicates poor pacing
- Variability Index (NP/AP) should be 1.00-1.03

Average Heart Rate:
- Useful for tracking across tests
- Lower HR at same power indicates improved efficiency
- Track maximal HR achieved for zone calculations

Power-to-Weight Ratio:
- Critical for climbing performance
- Calculate as FTP ÷ body weight (kg)
- Track separately from absolute power

**Secondary Metrics:**

Peak 5-minute power:
- Indicator of anaerobic capacity
- Should be 110-120% of FTP
- Ratio to FTP suggests athlete profile

Decoupling:
- HR drift relative to power in second half
- <5% decoupling indicates good aerobic fitness

RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):
- Same power feeling easier indicates adaptation
- Useful for identifying fatigue or overtraining

### Interpreting Results

**Expected FTP Progression:**

Beginner cyclists (0-2 years):
- 5-10% improvement per 8-week block
- Rapid gains from neuromuscular adaptation
- Expect 15-25W increases

Intermediate cyclists (2-5 years):
- 3-5% improvement per 8-week block
- Slower gains, require focused training
- Expect 8-15W increases

Advanced cyclists (5+ years):
- 1-3% improvement per 8-week block
- Marginal gains, require optimized training
- Expect 3-8W increases

**FTP Benchmarks (watts/kg):**

Recreational: 2.0-3.0 W/kg
Category 3-4 racer: 3.0-4.0 W/kg
Category 1-2 racer: 4.0-5.5 W/kg
Professional: 5.5-7.0+ W/kg

**When FTP Doesn't Improve:**

Possible causes:
- Insufficient recovery between hard sessions
- Too much intensity, inadequate aerobic base
- Overtraining or under-recovery
- Training plateau requiring new stimulus

Solutions:
- Implement recovery week (50% volume)
- Reassess training distribution (consider polarized model)
- Check sleep, nutrition, life stress factors
- Change training stimulus (different interval types)

### Test Scheduling

**Annual Periodization:**

Base Phase (12-16 weeks):
- Test at beginning and end
- Long interval between tests allows aerobic development
- Less frequent testing reduces psychological pressure

Build Phase (8-12 weeks):
- Test every 6-8 weeks
- More frequent assessment to adjust zones
- Track progression through training block

Peak Phase (4-6 weeks):
- Optional mid-phase test
- May skip testing to preserve freshness
- Racing provides performance validation

Race Season:
- Test every 8-12 weeks
- Avoid testing before key events
- Use races as performance indicators

**Micro-Level Scheduling:**

Within Week:
- Tuesday or Wednesday optimal (mid-week)
- Avoid Monday (weekend fatigue) or Friday (pre-weekend)
- Morning tests show less variability

Within Training Block:
- Week 1 or Week 2 of new block
- After recovery week
- Before starting new intensity phase

### Validation Strategies

**Comparing Test Protocols:**

Perform multiple test types in same week (fully recovered):
- 20-minute test Day 1
- Ramp test Day 4
- Results should agree within 5-10W

**Workout Validation:**

After FTP test, validate with training:
- 2x20min @ FTP should be difficult but completable
- Sweet spot (88-93% FTP) should feel "comfortably hard"
- If workouts too easy/hard, adjust FTP ±5W

**Performance Correlation:**

FTP should correlate with:
- Time trial performance (40km TT ≈ 95-100% FTP)
- Climbing power (sustained climbs at 90-100% FTP)
- Threshold interval completion rates

### Re-Testing Decision Matrix

**Definitely Re-Test:**
- Workouts consistently too easy (completing at 105%+ prescribed intensity)
- Significant fitness improvement felt
- 8+ weeks since last test
- After recovery from illness/injury

**Consider Re-Testing:**
- Workouts feeling slightly easier
- 6 weeks since last test
- Before starting new training phase

**Do Not Re-Test:**
- Currently fatigued or recovering
- <4 weeks since last test
- Mid-way through productive training block
- Shortly before key events
