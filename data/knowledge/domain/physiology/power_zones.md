# Power Zones in Cycling

## Overview

Power zones provide a systematic framework for prescribing training intensities based on physiological responses to exercise. By dividing the power spectrum into discrete zones, coaches and athletes can target specific adaptations—from aerobic base development to neuromuscular power. The most widely adopted system is Dr. Andrew Coggan's 7-zone model, which anchors all zones to Functional Threshold Power (FTP).

Power-based training zones offer significant advantages over heart rate zones: immediate feedback, no lag time, independence from environmental factors (heat, humidity, fatigue), and precise intensity control. Unlike heart rate, which fluctuates with hydration, temperature, and cardiac drift, power remains constant. This objectivity enables consistent execution of prescribed workouts and reliable tracking of training load over time.

Understanding power zones transforms training from art to science. Each zone targets distinct physiological systems with specific adaptations, recovery requirements, and optimal durations. Properly applied, zone-based training maximizes training efficiency by delivering the right stimulus at the right time, while minimizing wasted effort and reducing overtraining risk.

## Scientific Basis

Power zones correspond to metabolic thresholds and physiological systems. Zone 1-2 primarily utilize aerobic metabolism with fat as the dominant fuel source, minimal lactate accumulation, and sustainable durations measured in hours. Zone 3-4 represent the transition toward anaerobic contribution, increased carbohydrate utilization, rising lactate levels, and sustainable durations of 10-60 minutes. Zone 5-6 involve substantial anaerobic contribution, significant lactate production, and durations limited to 3-20 minutes. Zone 7 targets pure neuromuscular power with minimal aerobic contribution.

These zones align with measurable physiological markers. Zone 2 corresponds to approximately 60-75% VO2max and <2 mmol/L blood lactate. Zone 4 approximates the lactate threshold (2-4 mmol/L lactate) and 75-85% VO2max. Zone 5 targets VO2max intensity (90-100% VO2max) with lactate accumulation of 4-8 mmol/L. The zone system provides practical field-based training prescription that approximates laboratory-tested metabolic states.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Incorrect FTP Baseline**
   - Problem: Training zones based on outdated or inflated FTP
   - Why it matters: Zone 4 workouts become Zone 5, excessive fatigue accumulates
   - Solution: Test FTP every 6-8 weeks, adjust zones immediately after test

2. **Zone 2 Drift to Zone 3**
   - Problem: Easy rides creep into tempo intensity, "going hard on easy days"
   - Why it matters: Insufficient recovery, reduced quality on hard days, chronic fatigue
   - Solution: Strict power caps on easy days (75% FTP max), discipline over ego

3. **Insufficient Zone 1-2 Volume**
   - Problem: Excessive time in Zone 3-4, neglecting aerobic base
   - Why it matters: Aerobic system underdeveloped, limited performance ceiling
   - Solution: Follow 80/20 rule (80% time Zone 1-2, 20% Zone 3+)

4. **Confusing Zone 4 with Zone 5**
   - Problem: Executing threshold intervals at VO2max power
   - Why it matters: Different adaptation stimulus, inappropriate interval duration, premature fatigue
   - Solution: Reference zone chart, use power meter strictly, understand purpose of each zone

5. **Ignoring Zone-Specific Recovery Needs**
   - Problem: Scheduling Zone 5 workout 24 hours after Zone 4 session
   - Why it matters: Incomplete glycogen replenishment, reduced quality, injury risk
   - Solution: 48-72 hours between high-intensity sessions (Zone 4+), use Zone 1-2 for active recovery

6. **Overusing Zone 3**
   - Problem: Excessive tempo rides, "no man's land" training
   - Why it matters: High fatigue relative to adaptation, interferes with recovery
   - Solution: Limit Zone 3 to 10-15% of training time, favor polarized distribution

## Monitoring and Progression

### Power-Based Metrics

**Training Stress Score (TSS):**
- Quantifies training load based on intensity and duration
- Calculated from Normalized Power, Intensity Factor, duration
- Zone 2 ride: ~50-100 TSS per hour
- Zone 4 intervals: ~80-120 TSS per hour
- Zone 5 intervals: ~100-150 TSS per hour

**Intensity Factor (IF):**
- Ratio of Normalized Power to FTP
- Zone 2: IF 0.55-0.75
- Zone 4: IF 0.91-1.05
- Zone 5: IF 1.06-1.20
- Useful for assessing workout difficulty

**Time in Zone Analysis:**
- Track weekly/monthly distribution
- Compare to target distribution (e.g., 80/20 model)
- Identify drift from intended training focus

### Progression Strategies

**Base Phase Progression:**
Week 1-4: Establish aerobic base
- 85% Zone 2, 15% Zone 3-4
- Volume: 6-8 hours/week

Week 5-8: Increase volume
- 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 3-4
- Volume: 8-10 hours/week

Week 9-12: Volume peak
- 80% Zone 2, 15% Zone 3-4, 5% Zone 5
- Volume: 10-12 hours/week

**Build Phase Progression:**
Week 1-4: Threshold focus
- 70% Zone 2, 25% Zone 4, 5% Zone 5
- Volume: 9-11 hours/week

Week 5-8: VO2max introduction
- 65% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4, 15% Zone 5
- Volume: 9-11 hours/week

Week 9-12: Integrated intensities
- 65% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4, 10% Zone 5, 5% Zone 6
- Volume: 8-10 hours/week

### Adaptation Indicators

**Positive Signs:**
- Completing prescribed workouts as written
- Recovering well between hard sessions
- Progressive FTP increases
- Lower heart rate at same power (Zone 2)
- Improved sustainability at Zone 4-5 power

**Warning Signs:**
- Unable to complete Zone 4-5 intervals
- Elevated resting heart rate (>5bpm above normal)
- Decreased heart rate variability
- Persistent fatigue despite recovery
- Declining power at threshold

### Zone Refinement

**Individual Threshold Zones:**
Some athletes benefit from customized zones based on:
- Anaerobic capacity (Zone 6 athletes vs. Zone 2 specialists)
- Training history (more zones for experienced athletes)
- Event specificity (time trial vs. criterium vs. ultra-endurance)

**Alternative Zone Systems:**

5-Zone Model (simplified):
- Zone 1: <65% FTP (recovery)
- Zone 2: 65-85% FTP (endurance)
- Zone 3: 85-100% FTP (tempo/threshold)
- Zone 4: 100-120% FTP (VO2max)
- Zone 5: >120% FTP (anaerobic)

3-Zone Model (polarized training):
- Zone 1: <80% FTP (easy)
- Zone 2: 80-95% FTP (moderate/avoided)
- Zone 3: >95% FTP (hard)

**Adjusting for Individual Response:**

Athletes with high anaerobic capacity:
- May handle more Zone 5-6 work
- Zone 4 can be slightly higher percentage

Athletes with strong aerobic systems:
- Thrive on more Zone 2 volume
- Less Zone 5 needed for maintenance

Masters athletes (40+ years):
- Benefit from extended Zone 2 time
- Reduced Zone 5-6 frequency
- Longer recovery between hard sessions

### Integration with Heart Rate Zones

Power zones remain primary, but heart rate provides additional information:

**Cardiac Drift:**
- Rising heart rate at constant power indicates fatigue
- Useful in Zone 2 rides to assess aerobic fitness
- <5% HR drift = good aerobic conditioning

**Heat/Altitude Adjustments:**
- Power zones unchanged by environment
- Heart rate elevated in heat/altitude
- Rely on power, expect HR variation

**Illness/Overreaching Detection:**
- Elevated HR at easy power (Zone 2) suggests fatigue
- Suppressed HR at high power (Zone 5) indicates overreaching
- Cross-reference with RPE and recovery metrics
