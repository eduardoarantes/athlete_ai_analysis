# Lambda deployment dependencies
# Used by scripts/build-lambda.sh to create the deployment package
#
# Keep minimal for Lambda size limits (50MB zipped, 250MB unzipped)
# Do not include dev dependencies (pytest, mypy, etc.)

# Core

anthropic>=0.18.0
# openai>=1.0.0        # Uncomment if using OpenAI
# google-genai>=1.0.0  # Uncomment if using Gemini

# Data processing (minimal for API)

fitdecode>=0.10.0

# Configuration

# Note: The following large dependencies are intentionally excluded
# to keep Lambda package size manageable:
# - chromadb (400MB+) - Use external vector DB service instead
# - sentence-transformers (500MB+) - Use API-based embeddings
# - langchain (large, many deps) - Direct API calls instead
# - ollama (local only, not needed in Lambda)
# - boto3/botocore (provided by Lambda runtime)
