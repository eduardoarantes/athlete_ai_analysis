2. nutrition/recovery_nutrition.md
3. nutrition/hydration.md
4. physiology/heart_rate_zones.md

16. periodization/taper_phase.md
17. periodization/recovery_weeks.md

Wait, that's 17 files. Let me recount...

Actually 15 missing files total as per review.

### Total Estimated Effort
- **High Priority (9 files):** 6-8 hours
- **Medium Priority (6 files):** 3-4 hours
- **Total:** 9-12 hours of content creation

---

## Quality Standards (Match Current Files)

Each file should include:

1. **YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
category: <category_name>
difficulty: beginner|intermediate|advanced
source: <citation/reference>
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [relevant, tags, here]
---
```

2. **Structure:**
- Overview/Introduction
- Scientific Basis (with citations)
- Implementation Guidelines
- Common Mistakes
- References

3. **Length:** 1,500-2,000 words minimum
4. **Citations:** Proper attribution to research/experts
5. **Practical:** Balance theory with actionable advice

---

## Next Steps

1. Create files incrementally (don't need all at once)
2. After creating files, run: `cycling-ai index domain`
3. Test retrieval quality with sample queries
4. Monitor vectorstore size and performance

---

## Benefits of Expansion

With full 20+ file knowledge base:
- More comprehensive RAG context for agents
- Better coverage of training science topics
- Improved training plan recommendations
- More diverse retrieval results
- Richer coaching insights

---

## Notes

- Current 5 files demonstrate system works correctly
- Infrastructure is production-ready (98% test coverage)
- Content expansion is purely additive (no breaking changes)
- Can be done incrementally over time
- Priority should focus on nutrition (entire category missing) and high-use topics
