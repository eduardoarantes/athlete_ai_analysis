# 1.0 Guiding Principle: Architecting the Complete Athlete

Our philosophy is built on the non-negotiable principle that elite cycling performance is not merely the product of endurance, but the result of a meticulously architected, year-round synthesis of strength and endurance. This document outlines our methodology: a periodized, evidence-based approach to concurrent training designed to build resilient, powerful, and adaptable professional cyclists.

The central argument of this manifesto is that a systematic integration of strength training is a fundamental component for unlocking an athlete's ultimate potential. This integrated model is not an optional supplement but a strategic imperative that directly enhances on-bike performance, mitigates the risk of overuse injuries common in the sport, and ensures the long-term foundational health and career longevity of our athletes. By weaving strength development into the fabric of endurance training, we create a powerful synergy that produces results far greater than the sum of its parts.

This synthesis of strength and endurance is not left to chance; it is governed by a rigorous architectural framework. The proven methodology of periodization is the foundation upon which this entire system is built.

# 2.0 The Cornerstone: Periodized Concurrent Training

We utilize periodization as the unyielding architectural framework for all training. Our philosophy mandates the logical and systematic sequencing of training factors—such as volume, intensity, and recovery—to optimize performance at predetermined points. This structured approach prevents the performance plateaus and burnout that result from unstructured training, ensuring every workout serves a specific purpose in an athlete's long-term development.

At its core, periodization breaks down the annual training plan into manageable cycles, each with a distinct focus that allows for the safe and effective application of progressive overload.

| Training Cycle | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Macrocycle** | Represents the entire training year, structured around the primary competitive season and goals.                                                                     |
| **Mesocycle**  | A distinct block of training, typically lasting 3-6 weeks, focused on a specific physiological adaptation (e.g., building aerobic base, increasing threshold power). |
| **Microcycle** | The smallest cycle, usually a week-long pattern of specific workouts and rest days that forms the building block of a mesocycle.                                     |

Within this periodized framework, we implement **concurrent training**, the strategic integration of strength and endurance workouts. This is a delicate balancing act, as the adaptations for endurance (driven by the AMPK signaling pathway) and strength (driven by the mTOR pathway) can conflict at a molecular level. Our methodology is designed to sequence these sessions to achieve complementary adaptations, managing fatigue and promoting holistic physiological development.

To fully commit to this integrated model, it is essential to first understand the scientific and practical rationale for dedicating valuable training resources to building strength.

# 3.0 The Rationale: Analyzing the Evidence for Integrating Strength

The decision to dedicate valuable training and recovery resources to strength work is not based on tradition or intuition, but on a clear, evidence-based justification. Our commitment to concurrent training is founded upon three primary, research-supported pillars: direct performance enhancement, critical injury mitigation, and the promotion of long-term athlete health.

## 3.1 Performance Enhancement

A robust body of evidence demonstrates that systematic strength training directly translates to improved cycling performance for both male and female athletes. The primary benefits include:

• **Improved Exercise Economy:** Strength training enhances the efficiency of the musculoskeletal system, allowing the athlete to produce the same power output with less energy expenditure.

• **Postponed Activation of Type II Fibres:** By strengthening fatigue-resistant muscle fibres, the body can delay the recruitment of less efficient, fast-twitch type II fibres, preserving them for moments of maximal effort. This is achieved through the conversion of fast-twitch type IIX fibres into more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibres.

• **Enhanced Neuromuscular Efficiency:** Strength training improves the communication between the brain and muscles, leading to more coordinated and powerful muscle contractions and improved musculotendinous stiffness for a more effective pedal stroke.

• **Increased Power Output:** Developing maximal strength provides a higher ceiling for on-bike power, which is beneficial for accelerations, climbing, and sprinting.

## 3.2 Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation

The repetitive, single-plane motion of cycling can lead to muscular imbalances and overuse injuries. Strength training is a powerful tool for injury mitigation and is a key component of effective rehabilitation.

• **Correcting Muscular Imbalances:** Targeted exercises strengthen underdeveloped muscles (e.g., glutes, core) and improve joint stability, reducing strain on the lower back and knees—two of the most common sites of overuse injuries in cyclists.

• **Improving Core Stability:** A strong core provides a stable platform for power generation, preventing upper-body fatigue and poor posture that can lead to neck and back pain during long rides.

• **Rehabilitative Strength:** Following an injury, a structured strength program is crucial for restoring function, addressing the root cause of the injury, and safely returning the athlete to competition.

## 3.3 Foundational Health and Bone Density

Beyond immediate performance gains, strength training is critical for the long-term health of professional cyclists, particularly in an area where the sport itself can be detrimental.

• **Maintaining and Improving Bone Health:** Research has shown that professional cyclists, despite their high level of fitness, can exhibit lower bone mineral density. The low-impact nature of cycling does not provide the necessary stimulus for bone maintenance. Weight-bearing strength training is essential to counteract this effect, reducing the risk of fractures and promoting skeletal health throughout an athlete's career and beyond.

This body of evidence provides the strategic conviction to invest in concurrent training. With this "why" firmly established, we can now turn to the architectural blueprint that details the "how": our phased, year-long training model.

# 4.0 The Architectural Blueprint: The Phased Training Year

The annual plan (Macrocycle) is systematically broken down into three primary phases—Base, Build, and Specialty. Each phase has distinct objectives for both endurance and strength development, building upon the last to orchestrate a performance peak for the season's most important competitions. Our blueprint follows a sequential model where the full Base, Build, and Specialty cycle orchestrates a performance peak over approximately 28 weeks.

## 4.1 Base Phase: Forging the Foundation (8–12 weeks)

• **Endurance Goal: Building a Strong Aerobic Foundation** The primary objective of the Base Phase is to develop a deep and resilient aerobic engine. This is traditionally achieved through high-volume, low-intensity rides (Zone 2), which enhance the body’s ability to efficiently utilize oxygen and burn fat for fuel. For time-constrained athletes, a "Sweet Spot Base" approach, which incorporates intervals at 88–94% of Functional Threshold Power (FTP), can achieve significant fitness gains in less time.

• **Strength Goal: Anatomical Adaptation** Strength training during the Base Phase begins with a focus on structural adaptation to prepare muscles and connective tissues for heavier loads, a key component of our injury prevention strategy. A typical protocol involves **two sessions per week**. The initial weeks emphasize higher repetitions (e.g., 10-12 reps) at a lower intensity. As one of our athletes described, the load then progresses systematically: "gradually decrease after 4–5 weeks, down to eight repetitions, and eventually down to six repetitions." Common exercises include squats, deadlifts, and leg press to build foundational lower-body and core strength.

## 4.2 Build Phase: Raising the Ceiling (6–8 weeks)

• **Endurance Goal: Escalating Fitness and Elevating FTP** The Build Phase is designed to raise the athlete’s performance ceiling by directly targeting their Functional Threshold Power (FTP). Training becomes more intense, blending sustainable power workouts (Sweet Spot and Threshold intervals) with high-power intervals designed to increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2Max). This combination elevates the power an athlete can sustain for long durations while also improving their ability to handle repeated hard efforts.

• **Strength Goal: Maximal Strength and Power Development** Strength training progresses in parallel with endurance work. The focus shifts decisively toward maximal strength and power, characterized by increased intensity (heavier loads) and fewer repetitions. A key element is the emphasis on **explosive concentric movements** during lifts to improve the rate of force development, which translates directly to more powerful and snappier accelerations on the bike.

## 4.3 Specialty Phase: Sharpening the Blade (2–8 weeks)

• **Endurance Goal: Achieving Peak Fitness Through Race-Specific Intensity** In the final phase leading up to a goal event, training becomes highly specific to the demands of competition. Workouts are designed to mirror the intensity, duration, and cadence of the target race, sharpening the athlete’s fitness to a fine point. This phase incorporates **tapering**, a strategic and progressive reduction in training volume while maintaining intensity. This process minimizes accumulated fatigue, allowing the body to recover and supercompensate, thus revealing "freshness" for peak performance on race day.

• **Strength Goal: Maintenance and Power Conversion** The objective for strength training in the Specialty Phase shifts from building to maintaining. The frequency is strategically reduced to **one weekly session** to preserve the strength and neuromuscular gains achieved in the earlier phases without inducing fatigue that could compromise key endurance workouts or race performance.

Applying this blueprint during the intense and unpredictable competitive season presents a unique set of challenges that require a pragmatic and flexible approach.

# 5.0 Navigating the Competitive Season: A Pragmatic Approach to Maintenance

The competitive season, with its demanding race schedule, frequent travel, and accumulated fatigue, makes it practically impossible to continue a high-volume development program. This period requires a strategic shift in philosophy: the focus moves from building fitness to maintaining the hard-won gains from the off-season while managing the immense physiological and psychological stress of competition.

The shift to a single weekly maintenance session is a strategic necessity, not a compromise. It provides the minimum effective dose to retain neuromuscular adaptations, a critical intervention given that performance benefits can diminish significantly after just eight weeks of cessation. The primary goal is to preserve the neuromuscular adaptations and maximal strength developed during the Base and Build phases.

An in-season maintenance session is carefully calibrated to provide just enough stimulus to retain strength without compromising recovery or race-day performance. Key characteristics include:

• **Lower Volume:** A reduced number of sets and total repetitions.

• **Fewer Exercises:** Focusing on core, multi-joint lifts that provide the most benefit.

• **Intensity Management:** Maintaining load to preserve strength but avoiding excessive muscular damage or soreness.

Even with this reduced maintenance schedule, professional cyclists face significant logistical and physical hurdles that must be proactively managed to ensure consistency.

# 6.0 Addressing the Inevitable: Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

A robust coaching philosophy must be grounded in reality, accounting for the inevitable obstacles that athletes face. Consistently implementing concurrent training, especially during the competitive season, is fraught with challenges. This framework identifies the most significant of these hurdles and provides actionable strategies to mitigate their impact, ensuring the training plan remains effective and adaptable.

| Challenge                | Impact on Training                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Racing & Fatigue**     | High race loads and the resulting neuromuscular fatigue can impair the quality of strength sessions and increase the risk of overtraining. Strength work can also cause soreness that compromises subsequent race performance. | Schedule strength sessions at least **6 hours apart** from endurance workouts, a research-backed recommendation to **minimize interference**. During intense race blocks, prioritize recovery above all else—it is better to skip a maintenance session than to compromise race readiness. |
| **Frequent Travel**      | A demanding travel schedule across different time zones disrupts routines, sleep, and nutrition, making consistent gym access and planned sessions difficult to execute.                                                       | Proactively plan ahead to identify hotel gyms or nearby facilities at race locations. Maintain a backup plan of bodyweight or resistance band exercises that can be performed anywhere to ensure a maintenance stimulus is applied even with limited equipment.                            |
| **Access to Facilities** | Unpredictable schedules and stays in remote locations can mean limited or no access to proper gym facilities and equipment, disrupting the continuity of the strength program.                                                 | Adapt workouts to the equipment available. When possible, communicate with team staff to confirm facility access in advance. Utilize team resources, such as portable equipment or partnerships with local gyms, to bridge access gaps.                                                    |

Successfully navigating these challenges through foresight, flexibility, and clear communication is the key to implementing this philosophy and sustaining performance throughout a long and arduous season.

# 7.0 Conclusion: A Philosophy of Integrated and Adaptable Performance

This coaching philosophy is built on a single, powerful principle: peak cycling performance is achieved not by treating strength and endurance as separate entities, but by cultivating a symbiotic relationship between them. We architect complete athletes by systematically integrating evidence-based strength training into a periodized endurance framework, transforming it from an optional supplement into a fundamental pillar of performance.

Our methodology is defined by its core components: a clear, research-supported **rationale** for concurrent training; a phased **periodization model** that logically progresses from Base to Build to Specialty; and a **pragmatic, adaptable approach** to navigating the real-world challenges of in-season maintenance. By embracing this integrated system, we move beyond outdated training paradigms to build athletes who are not only more powerful and efficient but also more resilient to injury and better equipped for long-term health.

Our ultimate goal is to foster a culture of intelligent training that creates complete, durable, and consistently high-performing athletes year after year.
