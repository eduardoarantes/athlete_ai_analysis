The program begins with a Foundation phase to build a solid aerobic base and improve endurance. Weeks 5-7 shift focus to FTP development and VO\u2082max improvement through structured intervals. The Peak phase in weeks 9-10 emphasizes sharpening race-specific power, while the final two weeks taper volume for event readiness. The strategic 3:1 loading pattern ensures recovery and adaptation, aligning with the athlete\u2019s 7-hour weekly time budget. Long weekend rides capitalize on aerobic gains, while mid-week sessions target specific energy systems. The goal is to boost FTP from 236W to 260W (+10%) through progressive overload, emphasizing sweet spot and threshold zones.",
        "monitoring_guidance": "Key performance indicators include TSS (training stress score), LTL (long-term load), STL (short-term load), and freshness (LTL-STL). Monitor fatigue signs such as decreased power at threshold, elevated resting heart rate, and persistent muscle soreness. Freshness below \u221225 for more than three consecutive days signals overtraining risk; reduce intensity or add recovery. Weekly TSS progression should match the plan\u2019s target, with deviations adjusted based on perceived exertion and recovery. Conduct weekly power reviews to ensure FTP improvement aligns with expected gains. Aim for consistent gains in sweet spot and threshold intervals, with recovery weeks ensuring adaptation to the training load.",

If you feel good, you can treat the 40sec effort as a max effort to really push your body to the limit.\n\nIf you do this session on the ergo, please don't use ERG mode as the lag in resistance can be difficult and you will also limit yourself in the power range given sometimes. You are better off doing this as a free ride in level mode and producing the power yourself.\n\nEnsure your cadence doesn't drop too much in your recovery period.

If you feel good, you can treat the 40sec effort as a max effort to really push your body to the limit.\n\nIf you do this session on the ergo, please don't use ERG mode as the lag in resistance can be difficult and you will also limit yourself in the power range given sometimes. You are better off doing this as a free ride in level mode and producing the power yourself.\n\nEnsure your cadence doesn't drop too much in your recovery period.

                "description": "Aim is to accumulate a decent amount of time in and above zone 5. You will get a short 20sec rest that allows your legs to recover but your heart rate won't drop too much and then you have to go again.\n\nThe first couple of sets should be done to target power. If you feel good, you can treat the 40sec effort as a max effort to really push your body to the limit.\n\nIf you do this session on the ergo, please don't use ERG mode as the lag in resistance can be difficult and you will also limit yourself in the power range given sometimes. You are better off doing this as a free ride in level mode and producing the power yourself.\n\nEnsure your cadence doesn't drop too much in your recovery period. Recovery cadence should be >85rpm when possible.",
