**CROSS-TRAINING ANALYSIS (REQUIRED FOR THIS ATHLETE):**

This athlete participates in multiple sports. You MUST analyze cross-training impact:

5. Call analyze_cross_training_impact tool:
   - Use cache_file_path parameter with the same cache file from above
   - Set analysis_period_weeks to convert {period_months} months to weeks (multiply by 4.33)
   - This tool analyzes activity distribution, load balance, and interference patterns

6. Add "cross_training" field to your JSON response with these exact fields:
   ```
   "cross_training": {{
     "analyzed": true,
     "activity_distribution": [
       {{"category": "Cycling", "count": 45, "percentage": 65.0}},
       {{"category": "Strength", "count": 20, "percentage": 29.0}}
     ],
     "load_balance": {{
       "cycling_percent": 68.5,
       "strength_percent": 22.3,
       "cardio_percent": 9.2,
       "assessment": "Good balance for endurance cyclist with supplemental strength work"
     }},
     "interference_events": [
       {{
         "date": "2025-10-15",
         "activity1": "Heavy Squats",
         "activity2": "Threshold Intervals",
         "hours_between": 18.5,
         "score": 6,
         "explanation": "Leg-focused strength < 24h before hard cycling"
       }}
     ],
     "recommendations": [
       {{"text": "Schedule strength training 48+ hours before hard cycling sessions"}},
       {{"text": "Current 70/30 cycling/strength balance is appropriate for your goals"}}
     ]
   }}
   ```

**Important:**
- Extract data from the analyze_cross_training_impact tool result
- Use real numbers from the tool, not the example above
- Focus recommendations on scheduling conflicts and load balance
- If no interference events found, use empty array []
- Assessment should be personalized based on athlete's goals and training status
