Design a high-level {training_plan_weeks}-week training plan overview for this athlete.

**Athlete Profile:** {athlete_profile_path}

**Performance Data** (use this to inform your plan):
{performance_summary}

**Goal:** {goal_event_type}
**Athlete Level:** {athlete_level}  
**Training Constraints**:
- Available training days: {available_days} ({num_available_days} days/week)
- Weekly time budget: {weekly_time_budget_hours} hours
- Daily time caps: {daily_time_caps_json}

**Power Zones** (for reference):
{power_zones}

---

## Your Task

Call `create_plan_overview` with:

**CRITICAL**: The `weekly_overview` array MUST contain EXACTLY {training_plan_weeks} week objects.
Each week object MUST be fully populated with ALL required fields.

Example for a 3-week plan (you must create {training_plan_weeks} weeks):

```json
{{
  "athlete_profile_json": "{athlete_profile_path}",
  "total_weeks": {training_plan_weeks},
  "target_ftp": <your calculated target FTP in watts>,
  "weekly_overview": [
    {{
      "week_number": 1,
      "phase": "Foundation",
      "phase_rationale": "Establish aerobic base",
      "weekly_focus": "Endurance building",
      "weekly_watch_points": "Monitor fatigue and recovery",
      "training_days": [
        {{"weekday": "Monday", "workout_type": "rest"}},
        {{"weekday": "Tuesday", "workout_type": "endurance"}},
        {{"weekday": "Wednesday", "workout_type": "recovery"}},
        {{"weekday": "Thursday", "workout_type": "rest"}},
        {{"weekday": "Friday", "workout_type": "tempo"}},
        {{"weekday": "Saturday", "workout_type": "endurance"}},
        {{"weekday": "Sunday", "workout_type": "endurance"}}
      ],
      "total_hours": 6.8
    }},
    {{
      "week_number": 2,
      "phase": "Foundation",
      "phase_rationale": "Continue base building with progressive overload",
      "weekly_focus": "Increase endurance volume",
      "weekly_watch_points": "Watch for cumulative fatigue",
      "training_days": [
        {{"weekday": "Monday", "workout_type": "rest"}},
        {{"weekday": "Tuesday", "workout_type": "endurance"}},
        {{"weekday": "Wednesday", "workout_type": "sweet_spot"}},
        {{"weekday": "Thursday", "workout_type": "recovery"}},
        {{"weekday": "Friday", "workout_type": "tempo"}},
        {{"weekday": "Saturday", "workout_type": "endurance"}},
        {{"weekday": "Sunday", "workout_type": "endurance"}}
      ],
      "total_hours": 7.3
    }},
    {{
      "week_number": 3,
      "phase": "Build",
      "phase_rationale": "Introduce threshold work",
      "weekly_focus": "FTP development",
      "weekly_watch_points": "Monitor power at threshold",
      "training_days": [
        {{"weekday": "Monday", "workout_type": "rest"}},
        {{"weekday": "Tuesday", "workout_type": "sweet_spot"}},
        {{"weekday": "Wednesday", "workout_type": "recovery"}},
        {{"weekday": "Thursday", "workout_type": "threshold"}},
        {{"weekday": "Friday", "workout_type": "rest"}},
        {{"weekday": "Saturday", "workout_type": "endurance"}},
        {{"weekday": "Sunday", "workout_type": "sweet_spot"}}
      ],
      "total_hours": 7.8
    }}
  ],
  "coaching_notes": "<200-400 words explaining periodization strategy, target FTP rationale, progression logic>",
  "monitoring_guidance": "<150-300 words on KPIs to track, warning signs, when to adjust>"
}}
```

**IMPORTANT**: The above example shows 3 weeks. You MUST create ALL {training_plan_weeks} weeks with complete data.
DO NOT use empty objects {{}} or skip weeks. Every week from 1 to {training_plan_weeks} must be fully defined.

**Call the tool now to generate the complete {training_plan_weeks}-week plan overview.**
