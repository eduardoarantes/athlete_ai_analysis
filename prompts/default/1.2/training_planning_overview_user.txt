Design a high-level {training_plan_weeks}-week training plan overview for this athlete.

**Athlete Profile:** {athlete_profile_path}

**Performance Data** (use this to inform your plan):
{performance_summary}

**Training Constraints**:
- Available training days: {available_days} ({num_available_days} days/week)
- Weekly time budget: {weekly_time_budget_hours} hours
- Daily time caps: {daily_time_caps_json}

**Power Zones** (for reference):
{power_zones}

## Your Task

Call `create_plan_overview` with:

```json
{{
  "athlete_profile_json": "{athlete_profile_path}",
  "total_weeks": {training_plan_weeks},
  "target_ftp": <your calculated target FTP in watts>,
  "weekly_overview": [
    // Array of {training_plan_weeks} week objects
    // Each week must include all required fields (see system prompt)
    {{
      "week_number": 1,
      "phase": "Foundation",
      "phase_rationale": "Establish aerobic base",
      "weekly_focus": "Endurance building",

      ],
      "target_tss": 280,
      "total_hours": 6.8
    }},
    // ... weeks 2 through {training_plan_weeks}
  ],
  "coaching_notes": "<200-400 words explaining periodization strategy, target FTP rationale, progression logic>",
  "monitoring_guidance": "<150-300 words on KPIs to track, warning signs, when to adjust>"
