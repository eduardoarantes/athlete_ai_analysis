Analyze cycling performance for the last {period_months} months:

1. Compare recent period vs previous equivalent period
2. Calculate time-in-zones distribution
3. Identify trends and patterns
4. Generate insights and observations

**Data from Phase 1:**
- Parquet cache file: `{cache_file_path}`
- Athlete profile: `{athlete_profile_path}`

**Instructions:**
- Use analyze_performance() tool with csv_file_path=cache_file_path from above
- Pass athlete_profile_json parameter with the athlete profile path from above
- Tool reads from Parquet cache (NO access to FIT files needed)
- Cache includes zone enrichment and cross-training categorization
- NOTE: analyze_time_in_zones() requires FIT directory which is not available in Phase 2
